"""Outbox dispatcher: hands committed events to their handlers (docs/03-architecture.md §3.6).

The notification channel (Telegram, WhatsApp, e-mail, web push) is not chosen yet, so events are only logged
and marked processed. A channel plugs in as a handler per topic without touching the services.
